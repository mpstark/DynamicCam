An alternative is that the camera moves closer to your character's feet while performing this pitch. The \"Smart Pivot Cutoff Distance\" setting determines the distance that the camera has to be inside of to do the latter.

(While this can be a benefit for immersion, it may also cause nausea if you are prone to motion sickness.)\n\nThe \"Strength\" setting determines the intensity of this effect. Setting it to 0 disables head tracking. The \"Inertia\" setting determines how fast the camera reacts to head movements. Setting it to 0 also disables head tracking. The three cases \"standing\", \"moving\" and \"first person\" can be set up individually. There is no \"Strength\" setting for \"first person\" as it assumes the \"Strength\" settings of \"standing\" and \"moving\" respectively. If you want to enable or disable \"first person\" exclusively, use the \"Inertia\" sliders to disable the unwanted cases.\n\nWith the \"Range Scale\" setting you can set the camera distance beyond which head tracking is reduced or disabled. For example, with the slider set to 30 you will have no head tracking when the camera is more than 30 yards away from your character. However, there is a gradual transition from full head tracking to no head tracking, which starts at one third of the slider value. For example, with the slider value set to 30 you have full head tracking when the camera is closer than 10 yards. Beyond 10 yards, head tracking gradually decreases until it is completely gone beyond 30 yards. Hence, the slider's maximum value is 117 allowing for full head tracking at the maximum camera distance of 39 yards. (Hint: Use our \"Mouse Zoom\" visual aid to check the current camera distance while setting this up.)\n\nThe \"Dead Zone\" setting can be used to ignore smaller head movements. Setting it to 0 has the camera follow every slightest head movement, whereas setting it to a greater value results in it following only greater movements.

Since DynamicCam 2.0 we are automatically hiding most UI elements if their opacity is 0. Thus, this option of hiding the entire UI after fade out is more of a relic. A reason to still use it may be to avoid unwanted interactions (e.g. mouse-over tooltips) of UI elements DynamicCam is still not hiding properly.\n\nThe opacity of the hidden UI is of course 0, so you cannot choose a different opacity nor can you keep any UI elements visible (except the FPS indicator).\n\nDuring combat we cannot change the hidden status of protected UI elements. Hence, such elements are always set to \"just faded out\" during combat. Notice that the opacity of the Minimap \"blips\" cannot be reduced. Thus, if you try to hide the Minimap, the \"blips\" are always visible during combat.\n\nWhen you check this box for the currently active situation, it will not be applied at once, because this would also hide this settings frame.

The downside of this is that the UI is also shown when the Esc key is used for other purposes like closing windows, cancelling spell casting etc. Unchecking the above checkbox disables this.

Notice however that you can lock yourself out of the UI this way! A better alternative to the Esc key are the following console commands, which show or hide the UI according to the current situation's "Fade Out UI" settings:

    /showUI
    /hideUI

For a convenient fade-in hotkey, put /showUI into a macro and assign a key to it in your "bindings-cache.wtf" file. E.g.:

    bind ALT+F11 MACRO Your Macro Name

If editing the "bindings-cache.wtf" file puts you off, you could use a keybind addon like "BindPad".

Using /showUI or /hideUI without any arguments takes the current situation's fade in or fade out time. But you can also provide a different transition time. E.g.:

    /showUI 0

to show the UI without any delay.]]

DynamicCam (DC) was started in May 2016 by mpstark when the WoW devs at Blizzard introduced the experimental ActionCam features into the game. The main purpose of DC has been to provide a user interface for the ActionCam settings. Within the game, the ActionCam is still designated as "experimental" and there has been no sign from Blizzard to develop it further. There are some shortcomings, but we should be thankful that ActionCam was left in the game for enthusiast like us to use. :-) DC does not just allow you to change the ActionCam settings but to have different settings for different game situations. Not related to ActionCam, DC also provides features regarding camera zoom and UI fade-out.

The work of mpstark on DC continued until August 2018. While most features worked well for a substantial user base, mpstark had always considered DC to be in beta state and due to his waning investment in WoW he ended up not resuming his work. At that time, Ludius had already begun making adjustments to DC for himself, which was noticed by Weston (aka dernPerkins) who in early 2020 managed to get in touch with mpstark leading to Ludius taking over the development. The first non-beta version 1.0 was released in May 2020 including Ludius's adjustments up to that point. Afterwards, Ludius began to work on an overhaul of DC resulting in version 2.0 being released in Autum 2022.

When mpstark started DC, his focus was on making most customisations in-game instead of having to change the source code. This made it easier to experiment particularly with the different game situations. From version 2.0 on, these advanced settings have been moved to a special section called "Situation Controls". Most users will probably never need it, but for "power users" it is still available. A hazard of making changes there is that saved user settings always override DC's stock settings, even if new versions of DC bring updated stock settings. Hence, a warning is displayed at the top of this page whenever you have stock situations with modified "Situation Controls".

If you think one of DC's stock situations should be changed, you can always create a copy of it with your changes. Feel free to export this new situation and post it on DC's curseforge page. We may then add it as a new stock situtation of its own. You are also welcome to export and post your entire DC profile, as we are always looking for new profile presets which allow newcomers an easier entry to DC. If you find a problem or want to make a suggestion, just leave a note in the curseforge comments or even better use the Issues on GitHub. If you'd like to contribute, also feel free to open a pull request there.

Here are some handy slash commands:

    `/dynamiccam` or `/dc` opens this menu.
    `/zoominfo` or `/zi` prints out the current zoom level.

    `/zoom #1 #2` zooms to zoom level #1 in #2 seconds.
    `/yaw #1 #2` yaws the camera by #1 degrees in #2 seconds (negative #1 to yaw right).
    `/pitch #1 #2` pitches the camera by #1 degrees (negative #1 to pitch up).
